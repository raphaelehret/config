## Intention :

This application is intendeed as a [puush](http://puush.me/)-like app. It 
uploads your screenshots to Imgur and clipboards its link. 


## Requirements :

* gnome-screenshot
* xclip
* python >= 2.7
* Imgur API


## Usage :

The input arguments are the same as for `gnome-screenshot`

There is also the -k option to keep this screenshot even if the config variable is set as false

My personnal usage of it is -w for window screenshot or -a for an appended area.

## Intention :

As you sometimes have to copy and paste an other thing before pasting your screenshot,
recoverlink gives the possibility to put the last link back in the clipboard.

## Requirements

* Python >= 2.7
